/**
 * "SC" â€” Stepper and Servo Mode Configure
 * Command: SC,value1,value2<CR>
 * Execution: Immediate
 *
 * This command allows you to configure the motor control modes that the EBB
 * uses, including parameters of the servo or solenoid motor used for raising
 * and lowering the pen, and how the stepper motor driver signals are directed.
